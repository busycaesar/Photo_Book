# Photo_Book (My first HTML project)

## This was my first HTML project which I developed when I was in Grade 10. This was the time when I was introduced with HTML for the very first time and after learning it, I got so curious that I wanted to make something out of it. This was also the time when I was introduced with Facebook. Hence, I decided to make its clone. I was not aware much about front-end designing and naming convensions.

## One fine day while cleaning my harddisk, I found this.
