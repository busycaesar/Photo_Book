# Photo_Book (My Frist HTML project)

## This was my first HTML project which I made when I was in Grade 10. This was the time when I was introduced with HTML for the very first time and after learning this, I got so curious that I wanted to make something out of it. This was also the time when I use to be very active on Facebook. Hence, I decided to make something similar to it. This project might seem unorganized and improfessional which is due to the fact that I was not aware much about front-end designing and/or professionalism in IT at that time.

## One fine day while cleaning my computer, I found this.
